As technology pushes deeper into the human brain, the idea of neuro-terrorism becomes increasingly chilling. Imagine a world where influence doesn’t come through propaganda or persuasion but through direct manipulation 
of thought itself. In such a scenario, the human mind could become the ultimate weapon—used to carry out agendas without awareness or consent. The danger isn’t just physical harm but the erosion of mental autonomy and 
accountability: if someone’s thoughts can be externally shaped, where does responsibility begin or end? As brain–computer interfaces and AI decoding advance, we urgently need ethical and legal safeguards to protect the 
last frontier of privacy—the human mind.
