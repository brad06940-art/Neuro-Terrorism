This repository is a research archive dedicated to exploring claims, documentation, and theories related to the emerging concept of neuroterrorism â€” the use or misuse of neurotechnology, remote sensing, or psychological influence tactics intended to instill fear or manipulate perception.

**Purpose**

To compile documents, academic studies, and credible news reports concerning neurotechnology, neurowarfare, and psychological operations.

To preserve and categorize personal accounts of individuals who report experiencing remote or psychological influence, for research and analysis.

To encourage critical, transparent, and ethical discussion of potential technological abuse, disinformation, and fear-based control tactics in modern society.
