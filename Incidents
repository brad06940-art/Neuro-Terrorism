As technology pushes deeper into the human brain, the idea of neuro-terrorism becomes increasingly chilling. Imagine a world where influence doesn’t come through propaganda or persuasion but through direct manipulation 
of thought itself. In such a scenario, the human mind could become the ultimate weapon—used to carry out agendas without awareness or consent. The danger isn’t just physical harm but the erosion of mental autonomy and 
accountability: if someone’s thoughts can be externally shaped, where does responsibility begin or end? As brain–computer interfaces and AI decoding advance, we urgently need ethical and legal safeguards to protect the 
last frontier of privacy—the human mind.

As of October 2025 I believe the world has already seen several acts of terrorism carried out in a manner that could be considered neuro-terrorism, and I hope that this repository helps prove my suspicion and holds
those responsible accountable: 
Thomas Crooks - Attempted assassination of Donald Trump 
Luigi Mangione - Murder of Brian Thompson 
CAPTAIN Rebecca Lobach - Targeted and resulted in the collision between the Army Blackhawk Helicopter she was piloting and American Airlines Flight 5342
Tyler Robinson - Murder of Charlie Kirk
